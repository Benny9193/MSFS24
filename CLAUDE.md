# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Purpose

This is a **documentation repository** for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024—not a code project. It contains guides, reference materials, configuration backups, and personal flight logs.

## Content Types

- **guides/** - Tutorials organized by skill level and aircraft
- **reference/** - Checklists, charts, and keybind mappings
- **mods/** - Add-on organization and backups (liveries, scenery, aircraft)
- **configs/** - Graphics presets and controller profiles
- **notes/** - Flight logs and planning notes
- **assets/** - Screenshots and images for guides

## Working with Templates

Template files are prefixed with `TEMPLATE-` and should be copied (not edited directly) when creating new content:
- `reference/checklists/TEMPLATE-checklist.md`
- `reference/keybinds/TEMPLATE-keybinds.md`
- `notes/TEMPLATE-flight-log.md`

## Conventions

- All documentation uses Markdown format
- Aircraft-specific content should include ICAO codes where applicable
- Checklists use checkbox format (`- [ ]`) for interactive use
- Flight logs should include dates in YYYY-MM-DD format

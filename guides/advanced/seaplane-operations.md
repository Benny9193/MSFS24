## Pre-Flight Considerations

### Water Conditions Assessment
| Condition | Challenge | Technique |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| Glassy | No depth perception | Different technique |
| Choppy | Spray, pounding | Avoid if possible |
| Rough | Structural stress | Don't operate |
| Debris | Damage risk | Visual scan |
| Current | Drift | Plan for it |
| Wind | Crosswind/gusts | Standard technique |

### Float Inspection
- [ ] No damage or leaks
- [ ] Compartments pumped
- [ ] Water rudders functional
- [ ] Spreader bars secure
- [ ] Wheels up (amphibian)

### Site Assessment
- Wind direction and speed
- Water current direction
- Obstacles (boats, docks, debris)
- Depth adequate
- Takeoff/landing path clear

---

## Water Rudders

### Function
- Steering on water surface
- Connected to rudder pedals
- MUST be retracted for takeoff/landing
- Deploy for taxi only

### Operation
| Phase | Position |
|-------|----------|
| Taxi | DOWN |
| Before takeoff | UP |
| Landing | UP |
| After landing | DOWN |

### Why Retract?
- Can be damaged during planing
- Cause directional issues
- Essential to retract!

---

## Takeoff Procedures

### Normal Water Takeoff

**Taxi to Position:**
1. Water rudders DOWN
2. Taxi to takeoff area
3. Check wind/water conditions
4. Water rudders UP

**Takeoff Run:**
1. Smoothly apply full power
2. Apply slight back pressure
3. Floats rise onto step (planing)
4. Reduce back pressure
5. Accelerate on step
6. Aircraft lifts off naturally
7. Climb at Vy

### Planing Positions
| Position | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Displacement | Slow, floats settled |
| Plow | Nose high, bow in water |
| On step | Planing, efficient |
| Liftoff | Leaving water |

### Glassy Water Takeoff

**Dangerous Condition!**
- No visual depth reference
- Hard to tell speed
- Special technique required

**Technique:**
1. Apply power gradually
2. Get on step normally
3. Establish slight nose-up
4. Maintain attitude by instruments
5. Count seconds or use timer
6. Slight back pressure at expected Vr
7. Confirm liftoff by altimeter

### Rough Water Takeoff
1. Use waves as ramp
2. Time takeoff with swells
3. Accept longer run
4. Don't force rotation
5. Consider aborting if too rough

---

## Landing Procedures

### Normal Water Landing

**Approach:**
1. Normal pattern
2. Confirm water rudders UP
3. Wheels UP (amphibian!)
4. Check landing area clear
5. Final approach at Vref

**Touchdown:**
1. Flare normally
2. Slightly nose-high attitude
3. Touch tail (aft step) first
4. Let nose settle
5. Power to idle
6. Water rudders down when slow

### Glassy Water Landing

**Most Dangerous Procedure!**
- No depth perception
- Can't judge height
- Accidents common

**Technique:**
1. Set up longer final
2. Establish 100-200 ft/min descent
3. Set power for descent
4. DO NOT FLARE
5. Fly onto water at constant rate
6. Trust instruments
7. Full stall after touchdown

**Power-On Approach:**
- Keep power in until contact
- Provides height reference
- Safer technique

### Rough Water Landing
1. Land into wind/waves
2. Keep nose high
3. Touch tail first
4. Power off gradually
5. Accept bouncing
6. Don't fight it

### Crosswind Water Landing
1. No different than land runway
2. Wing low into wind
3. Touch upwind float first
4. Straighten after contact

---

## Water Taxi

### Idle Taxi
- Slow, displacement mode
- Water rudders down
- Full control with rudder pedals
- Weathervane tendency

### Step Taxi
- Faster, on step
- Water rudders UP
- Used for repositioning
- Watch for spray
- Caution: Speed = impact force

### Sailing
- Engine off, drift with wind
- Hold up wing into wind
- Control direction with rudder
- Useful for beaching/docking

### Docking Procedure
1. Approach slowly
2. Water rudders down
3. Engine to idle
4. Drift to dock
5. Engine off before contact
6. Line handlers catch aircraft

---

## Amphibian Procedures

### The Critical Check
**"WATER: Wheels Up!"**
**"LAND: Wheels Down!"**

### Common Fatal Error
Landing on water with wheels down = capsize/sink

### Confirmation Methods
- Visual check (see wheels position)
- Indicator lights
- Verbal callout
- Touch indicator
- Verify TWICE before every landing!

### Amphibian Checklist
```
WATER LANDING:
[ ] Landing area verified
[ ] WHEELS UP (check 3 times!)
[ ] Water rudders UP
[ ] Final approach check: WHEELS UP

LAND LANDING:
[ ] WHEELS DOWN (check 3 times!)
[ ] Three green lights
[ ] Gear horn silent
[ ] Final approach check: WHEELS DOWN
```

---

## Beaching

### Approach to Beach
1. Slow taxi approach
2. Water rudders UP
3. Tilt engine up (if outboard equipped)
4. Ease onto beach gently
5. Shut down immediately

### Departing Beach
1. Push aircraft into water
2. Lower engine/water rudders
3. Taxi to open water
4. Water rudders UP
5. Normal takeoff

### Beach Considerations
- Check for rocks/debris
- Note tide conditions
- Wind direction
- Slope of beach
- Soft sand = stuck!

---

## Emergencies

### Engine Failure Over Water
1. Best glide speed
2. Select landing area
3. Confirm water rudders UP
4. Land into wind/waves
5. Normal touchdown

### Water Rudder Failure
- Differential power (twins)
- Weathervane to desired direction
- Shut down and sail
- Plan longer taxi distances

### Capsizing
1. Exit immediately
2. Climb onto float/hull
3. Signal for help
4. Stay with aircraft
5. Don't exhaust swimming

### Sinking
1. Possible if float compartment breach
2. Exit quickly
3. Life jackets!
4. Stay near aircraft for visibility

## Special Operations

### Mountain Lake Landing

**Challenges:**
- Density altitude
- Short landing area
- Obstacles (trees, terrain)
- Glassy water common

**Technique:**
1. Recon pass first
2. Note wind indicators
3. Steep approach
4. Glassy water technique
5. Plan departure before landing

### River Landing

**Challenges:**
- Current affects ground speed
- Debris
- Variable width
- Obstacles

**Technique:**
1. Land upstream (into current)
2. Takeoff downstream
3. Current = wind for planning
4. Watch for logs/debris

### Confined Area Water

**Technique:**
1. Recon thoroughly
2. Know departure path
3. Land as short as possible
4. Turn around for departure
5. Abort if can't make it

## Weather Considerations

### Wind Effects
| Condition | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| Headwind | Shorter takeoff/landing |
| Tailwind | Longer, avoid if possible |
| Crosswind | Challenging taxi and landing |
| Gusts | Very challenging |
| Calm | Glassy water danger |

### Visibility
- Water spray reduces visibility
- Sun glare on water
- Haze over water
- Early morning fog

### Waves
| State | Height | Usability |
|-------|--------|-----------|
| Glassy | 0 | Caution |
| Smooth | <0.5 ft | Ideal |
| Slight | 0.5-2 ft | Good |
| Moderate | 2-4 ft | Challenging |
| Rough | >4 ft | No-go |

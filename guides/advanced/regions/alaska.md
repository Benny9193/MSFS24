## Aircraft for Alaska

### Bush Planes
| Aircraft | Role | Why |
|----------|------|-----|
| **Piper Super Cub** | Classic bush | STOL, rugged, simple |
| **de Havilland Beaver** | Workhorse | Float/wheel, reliable |
| **Cessna 185/180** | Utility | Powerful, versatile |
| **Cessna 206** | Cargo/pax | Bigger cabin |
| **Quest Kodiak** | Modern bush | STOL, turbine |
| **Pilatus PC-6** | STOL utility | Turbine, legendary |

### Floatplanes
- Essential for accessing 3 million+ lakes
- Straight floats vs amphibious
- Water landing technique different
- De Havilland Beaver = iconic

### Ski-Equipped
- Winter glacier landings
- Retractable skis (wheel-ski combo)
- Glacier pilots are elite specialists

## Weather Challenges

### Common Hazards
| Hazard | Description | Mitigation |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| **Fog** | Coastal, persistent | Alternate planning |
| **Icing** | Year-round threat | Altitude, avoidance |
| **Turbulence** | Mountain wave | Route planning |
| **Low Ceilings** | Interior valleys | Scud running dangerous |
| **Wind** | Aleutians extreme | 50+ kt common |
| **Whiteout** | Glacier, snow | Horizon reference lost |

### Seasonal Considerations

**Summer:**
- 20+ hours daylight
- Best flying season
- Thunderstorms possible
- Mosquitoes at strips!

**Winter:**
- 4-6 hours daylight
- Extreme cold (-40°F)
- Engine preheating essential
- Survival gear mandatory

**Spring/Fall:**
- Transitional, unpredictable
- Freeze/thaw cycles
- Changing ice conditions

## Flying Techniques

### Short Field Operations

**Takeoff:**
1. Max flaps for STOL
2. Full power against brakes
3. Release, accelerate
4. Rotate early, climb steeply
5. Clear obstacles

**Landing:**
1. Steep approach
2. Full flaps
3. Touch on numbers
4. Max braking
5. Sometimes <500 ft available

### Mountain Flying

**Ridge Crossing:**
- Cross at 45° angle
- 1,000 ft minimum above terrain
- Escape route planned
- Wind side = sink; lee side = turbulence

**Valley Flying:**
- Follow valley to higher terrain
- Always have turnaround point
- Weather can trap you
- Never fly into box canyon

### Glacier Landing

**Requirements:**
- Ski-equipped aircraft
- Glacier training
- Crevasse awareness
- Depth perception challenges

**Technique:**
1. Recon pass first
2. Assess slope, obstacles
3. Land uphill
4. Watch for crevasses
5. Takeoff downhill

### Float Operations

**Water Landing:**
1. Assess water conditions (glassy vs rough)
2. Glassy water = no depth perception
3. Use reference points
4. Step taxi for planing
5. Sail to shore if needed

## Survival Considerations

### Required Gear (Real World)
Alaska regulation requires survival equipment:
- Food for all passengers (2 weeks)
- Axe or hatchet
- First aid kit
- Firearm with ammo
- Fishing tackle
- Mosquito head nets
- Signaling devices
- Sleeping bag

### MSFS Immersion
Consider these factors for realism:
- Plan fuel conservatively
- Always have alternate
- Weather changes fast
- Remote = no rescue

## Communications

### Flight Following
- Anchorage Center covers most
- HF radio for remote areas
- Satellite (in real world)
- Many areas no radar coverage

### Common Frequencies
| Service | Frequency |
|---------|-----------|
| Anchorage Center | 132.400 |
| Fairbanks Approach | 128.050 |
| Juneau Approach | 126.150 |
| Flight Service | 122.200 |

### Pilot Reports (PIREPs)
- Critical in Alaska
- Share weather observations
- Help other pilots
- File via radio or online

---

## Challenges & Tips

### Density Altitude
- High elevations + warm temps
- Performance degradation
- Calculate before every flight
- Mountain strips especially

### Wildlife
- Runway moose/caribou common
- Bears near fish camps
- Bird strikes (eagles, geese)
- Low pass to clear runway

### Navigation
- GPS essential
- VORs limited
- Sectional charts
- Local knowledge valuable

### Emergency Planning
- File flight plan always
- ELT mandatory
- Tell someone your route
- Be prepared to survive

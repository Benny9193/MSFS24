## Glider Controls

### Primary Controls
| Control | Function |
|---------|----------|
| Stick | Pitch and roll |
| Rudder pedals | Yaw |
| Airbrakes/Spoilers | Increase drag, steepen descent |
| Trim | Relieve stick pressure |
| Wheel brake | Stop after landing |

### No Throttle!
- Pitch controls speed
- Pull back = slow down
- Push forward = speed up
- Energy management critical

### Airbrakes
- Extend to descend faster
- Used for landing approach
- Can modulate throughout approach
- Fully deployed = steep descent

## Types of Lift

### Thermals

**What They Are:**
- Rising columns of warm air
- Created by sun heating ground
- Strongest over dark surfaces
- 2-10 knots typical, up to 20+

**Finding Thermals:**
- Cumulus clouds mark tops
- Dark fields (plowed, asphalt)
- Cities, industrial areas
- South-facing slopes
- Watch for circling birds!

**Working Thermals:**
1. Enter thermal, feel lift
2. Turn toward strongest lift
3. Establish 30-45° bank circle
4. Stay in core (strongest part)
5. Climb to cloud base
6. Leave, find next thermal

**Thermal Technique:**
```
Enter thermal at min sink speed
Note variometer (lift indicator)
Turn toward strongest reading
Tighten circle if lift increases
Widen if lift decreases
Center in strongest lift
```

### Ridge Lift

**What It Is:**
- Wind deflected up by terrain
- Follows ridge/cliff line
- Constant, reliable lift
- Works any time with wind

**Requirements:**
- Wind 15+ knots
- Wind perpendicular to ridge
- Ridge at least 100 ft high
- Stable airflow

**Flying Ridge Lift:**
```
Fly parallel to ridge
Windward side only!
Make turns away from ridge
Maintain safe altitude
Fly at best L/D speed
```

**Ridge Rules:**
- Aircraft with ridge on right has right-of-way
- Pass between other aircraft and ridge
- Turns away from ridge
- Never turn toward ridge!

### Wave Lift

**What It Is:**
- Lee wave behind mountains
- Can extend to stratosphere
- Very smooth, very strong
- FL400+ possible!

**Indicators:**
- Lenticular clouds (lens-shaped)
- Standing waves in clouds
- Strong wind at surface
- Temperature inversions

**Wave Flying:**
```
Enter through rotor zone (turbulent)
Climb in smooth wave lift
Can reach 30,000+ ft
Supplemental oxygen required above FL125
Stay clear of lenticulars (severe turbulence)
```

## Soaring Techniques

### Thermalling

**Entry:**
1. Feel variometer rise
2. Wait 2-3 seconds
3. Roll into turn (30-45° bank)
4. Turn toward stronger lift

**Centering:**
- Shift circle toward strong lift
- Widen turn in lift
- Tighten turn in sink
- Keep coordinated!

**Leaving:**
1. Thermal weakening
2. Near cloud base
3. Good position for next thermal
4. Roll out, accelerate

### Cross-Country

**Goal:** Fly distance using natural lift

**Strategy:**
1. Climb high in thermal
2. Glide toward next lift
3. Speed to fly theory
4. Repeat until destination

**Speed to Fly:**
| Lift Ahead | Speed |
|------------|-------|
| Strong (5+ kt) | Slower glide |
| Weak (<3 kt) | Faster glide |
| Sink | Fastest (min sink speed) |

**MacCready Ring:**
- Set expected thermal strength
- Indicates optimal speed
- Balance speed vs height loss

### Final Glide

**Calculating:**
```
Height needed = Distance × Glide Ratio
Example: 20 nm to go, 40:1 glide
Height = 20 × 6076 ft/nm ÷ 40 = 3,038 ft
Add safety margin (500-1000 ft)
```

**Final Glide Tips:**
- Start with excess height
- Fly at speed-to-fly
- Monitor glide path
- Have alternates planned

## Launch Methods

### Aerotow

**Most Common Method:**
1. Tow plane pulls glider
2. Rope length ~200 ft
3. Hold position behind tow plane
4. Release at altitude (2,000-3,000 ft)
5. Tow plane descends, glider climbs

**Aerotow Positions:**
- High tow: Above wake
- Low tow: Below wake
- Never in propwash!

**Release:**
1. Confirm position
2. Pull release handle
3. Turn away from tow plane
4. Begin flight

### Winch Launch

**Fast, Economical:**
1. Cable attached to glider
2. Winch pulls at high speed
3. Glider zooms to ~1,500 ft
4. Cable releases automatically
5. Quick but lower altitude

### Self-Launch (Motor Glider)

**Convenience:**
1. Engine start on ground
2. Normal takeoff
3. Climb to altitude
4. Engine off, feather/retract
5. Soar normally

## Performance

### Glide Ratio (L/D)
| Ratio | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 30:1 | 30 ft forward for 1 ft down |
| 40:1 | 40 ft forward for 1 ft down |
| 50:1 | 50 ft forward for 1 ft down |

**In Practice:**
- 40:1 glider at 5,000 ft
- Can glide 40 nm in still air
- Wind affects this significantly!

### Polar Curve

**Shows:**
- Sink rate vs airspeed
- Minimum sink speed
- Best glide speed
- Performance envelope

**Key Speeds:**
| Speed | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| Min sink | Thermalling, max climb |
| Best L/D | Max distance glide |
| Maneuvering | Turns, aerobatics |
| Vne | Never exceed |

### Typical Performance
| Speed | Function |
|-------|----------|
| 45-50 kt | Thermalling |
| 55-65 kt | Best glide |
| 80-120 kt | Cruising |
| 100-150 kt | Vne |

## Instruments

### Critical Instruments

**Variometer (Vario):**
- Shows vertical speed
- In knots or m/s
- Most important soaring instrument!
- Audio = optional but useful

**Altimeter:**
- Shows height
- Watch your altitude!
- Plan final glide

**Airspeed Indicator:**
- Critical for safe flight
- Different speeds for different tasks
- Never exceed Vne

### Navigation
- GPS very useful
- Moving map
- Glide calculator
- Airspace awareness

### Total Energy Vario
- Compensates for stick movement
- Shows true air mass movement
- Better for thermal finding

---

## Safety

### Minimum Altitude
- Always have landing field reachable
- "1,000 ft pattern altitude" rule
- Lower = committed to land

### Stall Awareness
- Gliders stall at slower speeds
- Thermalling near stall
- Coordinated flight essential
- Spin recovery training critical

### Collision Avoidance
- Look outside constantly
- Thermals = multiple gliders
- Ridge = traffic patterns
- See and be seen

### Outlanding
- If no lift, you WILL land
- Always have field in range
- Scout fields from altitude
- Land into wind

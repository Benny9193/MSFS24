# Helicopter Operations Guide

Rotary-wing fundamentals, procedures, and techniques for MSFS 2024.

---

## Overview

| Aspect | Helicopter | Fixed-Wing |
|--------|------------|------------|
| Lift | Rotor disc | Wings |
| Hover | Yes | No |
| Runway | Not required | Required |
| Speed | Slower | Faster |
| Complexity | Higher | Lower |

---

## Flight Controls

### Cyclic (Pitch/Roll)
- Tilts rotor disc
- Controls pitch (fore/aft)
- Controls roll (left/right)
- Moves helicopter in that direction

### Collective (Power)
- Raises/lowers all blades equally
- Controls altitude/power
- Up = more lift, more power needed
- Down = less lift, descend

### Anti-Torque Pedals (Yaw)
- Controls tail rotor pitch
- Counters main rotor torque
- Left pedal = nose left
- Right pedal = nose right
- Critical in hover

### Throttle
- Often correlated with collective
- Maintains RPM
- Governor handles in many helicopters

## Basic Maneuvers

### Hover

**Establishing Hover:**
1. Increase collective slowly
2. Maintain heading with pedals
3. Use cyclic to stay stationary
4. Light on skids → airborne
5. Stabilize at 3-5 ft

**Hover Tips:**
- Small inputs only!
- Focus on distant reference
- Anticipate, don't react
- Constant minor adjustments

### Hover Taxi
1. Establish stable hover
2. Small forward cyclic
3. Maintain 5-10 ft altitude
4. Walking pace or slower
5. Use pedals to maintain heading

### Takeoff

**Normal Takeoff:**
1. Establish hover
2. Check instruments
3. Forward cyclic, increase collective
4. Accelerate through ETL (15-24 kt)
5. Climb at 60-80 kt

**Running Takeoff (Light Power):**
1. Forward cyclic from ground
2. Collective to maintain light on gear
3. Accelerate on surface
4. Collective for climb at 40+ kt

### ETL (Effective Translational Lift)
- Occurs 15-24 knots
- Rotor becomes more efficient
- Less power required
- Nose pitches up slightly
- Vibration changes

### Cruise Flight
1. Establish climb to altitude
2. Reduce collective for level
3. Trim as needed
4. Typical cruise: 100-130 kt
5. Power: 80-90% torque

### Approach

**Normal Approach:**
1. Reduce speed, begin descent
2. 500 ft/min at 60-70 kt
3. Decelerate through ETL
4. Transition to hover
5. Establish at 3-5 ft

**Steep Approach:**
1. Higher descent rate
2. Slower airspeed
3. Used for confined areas
4. More power at bottom

### Landing

**Hover Landing:**
1. Stabilize at 3 ft hover
2. Reduce collective slowly
3. Maintain position/heading
4. Touch skids/wheels gently
5. Full collective down

**Run-On Landing:**
1. Shallow approach
2. Slight forward speed at touchdown
3. Used for emergency/slope

---

## Advanced Maneuvers

### Quick Stop
1. Level flight at 60 kt
2. Reduce collective
3. Aft cyclic
4. Nose rises, speed decreases
5. Level before stopping
6. Establish hover

### Steep Turns
1. Enter at 90+ kt
2. Bank 30-45°
3. Add collective (load factor)
4. Maintain altitude
5. Roll out on heading

### Autorotation (Emergency)

**Entry:**
1. Engine failure = immediate collective down!
2. Maintain rotor RPM
3. Establish 60-70 kt glide

**Glide:**
- 1,500-2,000 ft/min descent
- Rotor spins via upward airflow
- Maintain RPM in green arc

**Flare:**
1. At 75-100 ft, aft cyclic
2. Slows descent and forward speed
3. Increases rotor RPM

**Touchdown:**
1. Level aircraft
2. Collective cushion
3. Touch down at near zero rate

### Pinnacle Landing
1. Recon approach
2. High approach angle
3. Terminate to hover
4. Check winds/obstacles
5. Spot landing

### Confined Area Operations
1. High recon (observe area)
2. Low recon (check obstacles)
3. Steep approach
4. Hover in clear area
5. Vertical departure

---

## Helicopter Emergencies

### Engine Failure (Low Altitude)
1. Collective DOWN immediately
2. Autorotate to nearest area
3. Flare and cushion
4. Priority: LAND SAFELY

### Engine Failure (Hover)
- Below 500 ft = little time
- Collective cushion
- Accept hard landing
- Keep level

### Tail Rotor Failure

**In Forward Flight:**
1. Reduce power (less torque)
2. Maintain ETL+
3. Run-on landing required
4. Expect right yaw at touchdown

**In Hover:**
1. Full power climb
2. Gain forward speed
3. Run-on landing

### Settling with Power (Vortex Ring State)

**Conditions:**
- Descent >300 ft/min
- Forward speed <ETL
- Moderate to high power

**Recovery:**
1. Nose down
2. Reduce collective
3. Gain forward airspeed
4. Exit at ETL

### Rooftop/Helipad
1. Approach from downwind
2. Clear landing area
3. Vertical descent
4. Center on pad
5. Departure into wind

### Slope Landing
1. Approach uphill
2. Low hover over slope
3. Uphill skid first
4. Level collective down
5. Keep cyclic into slope

### Offshore/Ship
1. Approach from downwind
2. Match ship heading
3. Deck-lock landing
4. Blade tie-downs
5. Be aware of ship motion

## Weight & Balance

### Key Terms
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| MGW | Max Gross Weight |
| CG | Center of Gravity |
| Longitudinal | Fore-aft balance |
| Lateral | Left-right balance |

### CG Effects
| CG Position | Effect |
|-------------|--------|
| Forward | Tail high hover, fast cruise |
| Aft | Tail low, hard to control |
| Left | Left pedal required |
| Right | Right pedal required |

### Performance Planning
- Hot = less power
- High = less power
- Heavy = less power
- Calculate before flight!

---

## Weather Considerations

### Wind
| Condition | Challenge |
|-----------|-----------|
| Crosswind | Drift, tail rotor authority |
| Tailwind | Loss of ETL benefit |
| Gusty | Control workload |
| Strong | May exceed limits |

### Visibility
- Helicopters often fly lower
- More exposure to weather
- Need visual references
- IFR helicopters exist but rare

### Density Altitude
- Critical for helicopters
- Power available decreases
- Performance charts essential
- Consider weight reduction

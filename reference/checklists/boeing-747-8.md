## Emergency Quick Reference

**Engine Fire on Ground:**
1. Thrust levers - CLOSE affected engine
2. Fuel control - CUTOFF
3. Fire handle - PULL
4. If fire persists - ROTATE & discharge
5. Evacuate if necessary

**Engine Failure After V1:**
1. Continue takeoff
2. Rotate at VR
3. Maintain V2, wings level
4. Gear UP at positive climb
5. Identify failed engine - "Dead leg, dead engine"
6. Follow EICAS/QRH

**Go Around:**
1. TOGA - PRESS
2. Thrust levers - TOGA
3. Pitch - 15° initial
4. Positive climb - GEAR UP
5. Flaps - 20°
6. Follow missed approach
